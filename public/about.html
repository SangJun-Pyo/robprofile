      <!-- Mission Section -->
      <section class="legal-section">
        <h2 data-i18n="about_mission_title">Our Mission</h2>
        <p data-i18n="about_mission_p1">Roblox Archetype was created with a simple but meaningful goal: to help Roblox players better understand their unique gaming identity. With over 70 million daily active users on the Roblox platform, each player interacts with games, communities, and creative tools in their own distinct way. We believe that understanding your playstyle can enrich your gaming experience and help you discover new content that truly matches your preferences.</p>
        <p data-i18n="about_mission_p2">Our tool categorizes players into one of eight distinct archetypes &mdash; Explorer, Grinder, Socializer, Competitor, Builder, Trader, Roleplayer, and Casual &mdash; based on publicly available profile data. Think of it as a personality framework designed specifically for how you enjoy Roblox. Just as MBTI and similar frameworks help people understand their interpersonal tendencies, Roblox Archetype helps you understand your gaming tendencies.</p>
        <p data-i18n="about_mission_p3">We are committed to keeping this tool completely free, requiring no login for basic analysis, and respecting your privacy at every step. Our mission extends beyond simple classification &mdash; we aim to foster self-awareness in gaming, encourage players to explore new genres they might enjoy, and build a shared vocabulary for the diverse ways people experience the Roblox platform.</p>

      <!-- Methodology Section -->
      <section class="legal-section">
        <h2 data-i18n="about_method_title">Our Analysis Methodology</h2>
        <p data-i18n="about_method_intro">Our archetype classification system uses a multi-step analytical pipeline to transform raw profile data into meaningful playstyle insights. Below is a detailed overview of how our algorithm works, from data collection to final score output.</p>

        <div class="methodology-steps">
          <div class="method-step">
            <div class="step-number">1</div>
            <div class="step-content">
              <h3 data-i18n="about_step1_title">Data Collection</h3>
              <p data-i18n="about_step1_desc">When you enter a Roblox username, our system queries the official Roblox public API to gather openly available profile information. This includes your account creation date, badge inventory, group memberships, and avatar configuration. We only access data that is publicly visible on your profile &mdash; the same information any Roblox user could see by visiting your profile page. No private data is ever accessed, and no authentication is required for the quick analysis. This data collection step typically completes within one to two seconds depending on the size of your public profile.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="method-step">
            <div class="step-number">2</div>
            <div class="step-content">
              <h3 data-i18n="about_step2_title">Keyword &amp; Category Analysis</h3>
              <p data-i18n="about_step2_desc">Once the raw data is collected, our algorithm performs keyword and category analysis on your badges and group memberships. Each badge name and group name is scanned against a curated dictionary of over 200 gaming-related keywords organized into archetype categories. For example, badges containing words like "explore," "discover," or "adventure" contribute to the Explorer score, while groups related to "PvP," "competitive," or "tournament" contribute to the Competitor score. The keyword dictionary is continuously refined based on trends in the Roblox gaming ecosystem to ensure accurate classification across both popular and niche games.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="method-step">
            <div class="step-number">3</div>
            <div class="step-content">
              <h3 data-i18n="about_step3_title">Behavioral Heuristics</h3>
              <p data-i18n="about_step3_desc">Beyond keyword matching, our system applies behavioral heuristics that consider broader patterns in your profile. For instance, a player with a very high number of distinct badges across many different games likely exhibits Explorer tendencies, while a player with deep badge collections within a few specific games shows Grinder characteristics. Account age relative to badge count helps distinguish Casual players from dedicated ones. Group membership patterns &mdash; such as belonging to creative development groups versus competitive clan groups &mdash; add another dimension of signal. These heuristics are weighted and combined to produce raw archetype scores that reflect the complexity of real player behavior rather than relying on simple keyword counts alone.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="method-step">
            <div class="step-number">4</div>
            <div class="step-content">
              <h3 data-i18n="about_step4_title">Score Normalization &amp; Output</h3>
              <p data-i18n="about_step4_desc">In the final step, raw archetype scores are normalized on a 0&ndash;100 scale to produce your complete playstyle profile. The normalization process ensures that scores are comparable across players with different amounts of public data. Your primary archetype is determined by the highest normalized score, and a confidence percentage is calculated based on how much data was available and how strongly the signals aligned. Players with richer public profiles typically receive higher confidence ratings. The output includes your primary archetype, scores for all eight types displayed as a visual bar chart, and a confidence indicator so you can assess how reliable the analysis is for your specific profile.</p>

      <!-- Team Section -->
      <section class="legal-section">
        <h2 data-i18n="about_team_title">Our Team</h2>
        <p data-i18n="about_team_p1">Roblox Archetype is built and maintained by a small team of gaming enthusiasts and web developers who are passionate about the intersection of data analysis and gaming culture. Our team members bring experience in front-end development, API design, and player behavior research, united by a shared love for the Roblox platform and its diverse community of players.</p>
        <p data-i18n="about_team_p2">We are an independent project and are not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Roblox Corporation. The "Roblox" name and related trademarks are the property of Roblox Corporation. Our analysis tool was built as a fan project to celebrate and explore the rich variety of playstyles that the Roblox ecosystem supports.</p>
        <p data-i18n="about_team_p3">We actively listen to community feedback to improve our classification accuracy and user experience. If you have suggestions, notice any issues with your analysis results, or would like to collaborate with us, please do not hesitate to reach out through our <a href="/#contact">contact form</a>. Every message is read and considered by our team.</p>

      <!-- Accuracy & Limitations -->
      <section class="legal-section">
        <h2 data-i18n="about_accuracy_title">Accuracy &amp; Limitations</h2>
        <p data-i18n="about_accuracy_p1">We believe in being transparent about what our tool can and cannot do. The quick analysis feature relies exclusively on publicly available data, which means it provides an estimate rather than a definitive classification. Players who have limited public profile information &mdash; such as new accounts or profiles with strict privacy settings &mdash; will naturally receive lower confidence scores and potentially less accurate results.</p>
        <p data-i18n="about_accuracy_p2">Our archetype system simplifies the complex reality of player behavior into eight categories for ease of understanding. In practice, most players exhibit traits from multiple archetypes, and your dominant archetype may shift over time as your gaming habits evolve. The analysis captures a snapshot of your current public profile and does not track changes over time.</p>
        <p data-i18n="about_accuracy_p3">The full analysis mode, which combines OAuth-verified profile data with an optional personality survey, generally provides higher confidence results because it has access to verified account ownership and additional self-reported data points. We recommend the full analysis for the most comprehensive understanding of your playstyle.</p>
        <p data-i18n="about_accuracy_p4">Our confidence ratings are honest: a 30% confidence score means we have limited data and the classification should be taken lightly, while a 70%+ confidence score indicates strong alignment between your profile data and the identified archetype. We would rather give you an honest low-confidence result than an overconfident inaccurate one.</p>
