            <p data-i18n="faq_a7">Our quick analysis uses only publicly available data from your Roblox profile, including your badge collection, group memberships, account age, and avatar configuration.

            <summary data-i18n="faq_q8">Can my archetype change over time?</summary>
            <p data-i18n="faq_a8">Yes, absolutely! Your archetype reflects your current gaming behavior as captured in your public profile. As you play different types of games, join new groups, and earn new badges, your archetype scores may shift. A player who starts as a Casual might evolve into a Grinder or Competitor as they develop deeper gaming interests. We recommend re-analyzing every few months to see how your playstyle evolves.</p>

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary data-i18n="faq_q9">Why is my confidence score low?</summary>
            <p data-i18n="faq_a9">A low confidence score typically means that your public profile has limited data for our algorithm to analyze. This can happen if your account is relatively new, if you have few public badges or group memberships, or if your privacy settings restrict what is publicly visible. To improve your confidence score, you can make more profile sections public or try the full analysis with Roblox login for verified, higher-quality data.</p>

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary data-i18n="faq_q10">How is this different from other personality quizzes?</summary>
            <p data-i18n="faq_a10">Unlike traditional personality quizzes that rely solely on self-reported answers, Roblox Archetype combines actual behavioral data from your profile with optional survey responses. This data-driven approach means your results reflect how you actually play, not just how you think you play. Our methodology analyzes real patterns in your badges, groups, and account activity to provide an evidence-based playstyle classification that is unique to your Roblox experience.</p>
