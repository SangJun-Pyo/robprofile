        <h2 data-i18n="disc_affiliation_title">Non-Affiliation with Roblox Corporation</h2>
        <p data-i18n="disc_affiliation_p1">Roblox Archetype is an independent, community-driven fan project. We are not affiliated with, endorsed by, sponsored by, or in any way officially connected with Roblox Corporation or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates. The official Roblox website is available at <a href="https://www.roblox.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.roblox.com</a>.</p>

        <h2 data-i18n="disc_entertainment_title">Entertainment Purpose Only</h2>
        <p data-i18n="disc_entertainment_p1">The playstyle archetype analysis provided by this website is designed purely for entertainment and informational purposes. Our analysis results are generated algorithmically based on publicly available profile data and should be treated as fun, approximate characterizations of gaming behavior rather than scientifically validated psychological assessments.</p>
        <p data-i18n="disc_entertainment_p2">The eight archetype categories (Explorer, Grinder, Socializer, Competitor, Builder, Trader, Roleplayer, and Casual) are simplified models of player behavior intended to be engaging and easy to understand. They do not represent clinical, psychological, or academic classifications. Users should not make significant personal, social, or financial decisions based on the results provided by our tool.</p>

      <section class="legal-section">
        <h2 data-i18n="disc_accuracy_title">Analysis Accuracy Disclaimer</h2>
        <p data-i18n="disc_accuracy_p1">While we strive to provide meaningful and interesting results, we cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of our archetype analysis. The analysis is based on a limited set of publicly available data points, which may not fully represent a player's actual gaming habits, preferences, or personality.</p>
        <p data-i18n="disc_accuracy_p2">Factors that can affect accuracy include but are not limited to: limited public profile data, privacy settings that restrict available information, recently created accounts with minimal activity, changes in gaming habits that are not yet reflected in profile data, and the inherent limitations of algorithmic classification. Confidence scores displayed alongside results are meant to help users understand the relative reliability of their specific analysis, and low confidence scores should be interpreted with appropriate caution.</p>
        <p data-i18n="disc_accuracy_p3">We do not warrant that the results will accurately reflect your true playstyle, and we disclaim all liability for any conclusions drawn from the analysis results. The tool is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis without any warranties of any kind, either express or implied.</p>

        <h2 data-i18n="disc_thirdparty_title">Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p data-i18n="disc_thirdparty_p1">Roblox Archetype integrates with and relies on several third-party services to function, including the Roblox public API, Roblox OAuth 2.0 authentication, Formspree for contact form processing, Google AdSense for advertising, and Cloudflare for hosting and content delivery. We are not responsible for the availability, accuracy, or content of these third-party services.</p>
        <p data-i18n="disc_thirdparty_p2">Changes to the Roblox API, its availability, data format, or access policies could affect the functionality of our analysis tool without notice. We make reasonable efforts to keep our service operational but cannot guarantee uninterrupted access. Each third-party service is governed by its own terms of service and privacy policy, which we encourage you to review independently.</p>

The archetype classifications and descriptions are creative interpretations of gaming behavior patterns and should not be used as a substitute for professional consultation in any field.</p>
        <p data-i18n="disc_advice_p2">If you have concerns about gaming habits, screen time, or any behavioral patterns, we encourage you to consult with a qualified professional. Our tool is meant to be a lighthearted way to explore your gaming identity, not a diagnostic or advisory instrument.</p>
